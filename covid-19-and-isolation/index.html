What is the point of no return? Do I continue to work? Can I afford to pay my bills? If I get infected, will that put my family at risk? Do I isolate everyone in my family, or just myself? There is so much to take into account, it’s daunting. The feeling of being put into the position of being responsible for the health and wellbeing of others is always going to be difficult, but this situation makes it even more difficult.</p><p>Running a couple of businesses and having two kids has raised a few hard questions that we’ve had to answer. We’ve spent countless hours trying to figure out what to do, and it’s definitely… not easy. I feel for the people who have immunocompromised family members, or family who are in the at risk categories. Our family is fairly healthy, so we’re not too concerned, but for those less fortunate than us, it has to be a very scary time.</p><p>How do we keep living? How do we move forward? Is there any way we can continue to live, or is our only choice to subsist. We’ve seen similar clichés pop up in movies over the years, with the likes of zombie outbreaks and vampirism. But this is all too real.</p><h3 id="what-have-we-chosen-to-do" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/covid-19_and_isolation/#what-have-we-chosen-to-do" class="header-mark"></a>What have we chosen to do?</h3><p>We’re going to isolate as best as we can, regardless of if we do or don’t contract COVID-19. The main reasons are quite simple.</p><p>If we <strong>do not</strong> contract the virus, we need to keep it at bay as long as possible. This has a fair few knock on effects. Basically, we don’t want to contribute to an overloaded health system, and we don’t want to contribute to the spread of the virus. We want to help keep the progression of the virus under control, and the best way to do that, is to try to keep it at bay as long as we can.</p><p>We also have a fair amount of family members in the at risk categories, and the last thing we want, is to be responsible for causing them any unnecessary suffering. We don’t want to cause <em>anyone</em> any suffering for that matter. It would be too much to bear if we found out we were the cause of pain for anyone else.</p><p>On the other hand, if we <strong>do</strong> contract the virus, then we will isolate anyway, so it’s better to start out mostly isolated to begin with.</p><p>But then, how do we continue to live, and not just subsist? Isolation does not have to be the end of the world. The way we figure it, based on the current research, infection occurs through the mouth and eyes, possibly nose. So can we continue to keep the businesses running during this crisis?</p><h3 id="keeping-the-business-open" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/covid-19_and_isolation/#keeping-the-business-open" class="header-mark"></a>Keeping the business open</h3><p>We know the methods of transmission, so guarding against the transmission is the best way to move forward. But what does that mean for the businesses? We’ve decided to keep them open as long as possible, <em>but</em> we will need to put in place some rules so that either we’re unlikely to get infected, <em>or</em> we are unlikely to infect others.</p><p>In the coming days, we’ll be designing methods to allow us to continue trading, without putting us all at risk.</p><p>Simple things that could make all the difference include:</p><ul><li>Wearing a face mask</li><li>Wearing disposable gloves</li><li>Wearing protective glasses</li><li>Washing our hands after every customer</li><li>Keeping a reasonable distance between us and customers</li><li>Not having direct contact with customers</li><li>No samples or testers</li><li>Disinfecting communal surfaces like the counter</li><li>Using contactless payment methods like PayWave and Bank transfers</li><li>More to come…</li></ul><p>These are just some of the possible rules we’ll implement, there are a fair few more that we’re still talking about. Basically, we’re thinking about setting up a kind of invisible barrier, so that we can continue to help our customers, without contributing to the problem.</p><h3 id="move-forward" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/covid-19_and_isolation/#move-forward" class="header-mark"></a>Move forward</h3><p>Just remember to be safe; stay as healthy as you can, and do all you can to look after the people closest to you. Be prepared, but don’t panic.</p><p>Think of those around you. The person who is infected should not be ostracised. The person who is not yet infected, is not a target of jealousy.</p><p>We’re in this together, let’s just get through this. :)</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on May 31, 2020</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><img class="u-author__avatar" src="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/media/website/logo.png" loading="lazy" alt="ThatKiwiGuy"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/authors/thatkiwiguy/" title="ThatKiwiGuy">ThatKiwiGuy</a></h4><p>The Crazy Vaping Kiwi Guy with a Computer.</p></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/the-new-workflow/" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/labgore-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>The New Workflow</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/voice-acting-pricing-table/" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Voice Acting - Pricing Table</h5></div><img src="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/media/posts/23/responsive/1_GZtfpHMxf03765DlVaxohg-xs.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box featured"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured__container"><li class="featured__item"><a href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/viewskew-pricing-table/" class="featured__image-link"><img src="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/media/posts/5/responsive/pricing-xs.jpg" alt=""></a><div><a href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/viewskew-pricing-table/" class="featured__title">ViewSkew - Pricing Table</a> <time class="u-small" datetime="2020-04-04T13:00">April 4, 2020</time></div></li><li class="featured__item"><a href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/skills/" class="featured__image-link"><img src="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/media/posts/6/responsive/original-xs.jpg" alt=""></a><div><a href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/skills/" class="featured__title">ViewSkew - Skills</a> <time class="u-small" datetime="2020-04-04T13:00">April 4, 2020</time></div></li><li class="featured__item"><a href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/lockdown-trading-hours/" class="featured__image-link"><img src="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/empty-office-xs.jpg" alt=""></a><div><a href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/lockdown-trading-hours/" class="featured__title">ViewSkew - COVID19 Trading Hours</a> <time class="u-small" datetime="2020-04-03T13:38">April 3, 2020</time></div></li><li class="featured__item"><a href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/voice-acting-pricing-table/" class="featured__image-link"><img src="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/media/posts/23/responsive/1_GZtfpHMxf03765DlVaxohg-xs.png" alt=""></a><div><a href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/voice-acting-pricing-table/" class="featured__title">Voice Acting - Pricing Table</a> <time class="u-small" datetime="2020-04-02T18:00">April 2, 2020</time></div></li></ul></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/posts/blog/">Blog</a> <span class="u-small">(2)</span></li><li><a href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/posts/blog-personal/">Blog - Personal</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li><li><a href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/posts/blog-technology/">Blog - Technology</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li><li><a href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/posts/vapefam/">VapeFam</a> <span class="u-small">(3)</span></li><li><a href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/posts/vapefam-law/">VapeFam - Law</a> <span class="u-small">(2)</span></li><li><a href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/posts/viewskew/">ViewSkew</a> <span class="u-small">(4)</span></li><li><a href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/posts/voiceacting/">Voice Acting</a> <span class="u-small">(13)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://thatkiwiguy.github.io/thatkiwiguy.github.io/">TKG&#x27;s Projektz</a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>@ThatKiwiGuy 2020</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
