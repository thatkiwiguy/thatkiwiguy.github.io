                <p>Eddie Checkmate: The first ever world champion and the face of the CWA. The self processed “Measuring Stick” of the CAW League of Nations. Eddie Checkmate strives (and usually succeeds) to be the gold standard of what a main-eventer should be. Eddie Checkmate talks, walks, and acts with confidence, will work until his last breath to get whatever he wants and never backs off from a fight. He is big-hearted, level-headed, and a bit too serious for his own good sometimes. In his defense, his two best friends Robert Squared and Lodestar Luminous are a couple of idiots. Eddie is a big brother/father figure to many of the younger talent of CWA and acts as its locker room leader, guiding them and showing just how good they can be.</p>

<li>I don’t believe I’ve introduced myself to you. I’m the Measuring Stick of the CLON (pronounced klon). I’m the frontier of CWA and its first World Champion. I’m the Samoan Success Story and I’m the Unconquered King of CAW. But you can just call me… Eddie Checkmate BAYBAY!</li>
<li>I don’t know about you, but having an asterisk near my victories in the history books is NOT an option.</li>
<li>Sometimes, even the strongest wills need a helping hand to get out of those pits they fall in. I only had the sounds of my cousin Robert calling out to me to drive me to climb myself out of there.  Now I’m gonna make sure that nobody has to go through what I did… EVER again.</li>

                <p>Thresh is a barbarian, more specifically the last of his tribe. He now roams the lands of Kingsfield looking for work. Thresh is not looking for vengeance, but taking life day by day trying to survive. He has major PTSD when people touch/catch him off guard so he responds in violent rage. He's not a bad guy, he can be very responsive, nice, and helpful when you get to know him, but naturally he's socially awkward. Looking for a smooth deep voice for this character that can deliver serious lines!</p>

                <p>Count Lucio used to rule Vesuvia with his wife, Nadia until he was murdered three years before the start of the game. Allegedly he was burned alive in his bed by Julian Devorak, on the night of the masquerade – a city wide birthday celebration he threw himself. Now he haunts the palace, but he is not out for revenge.</p>
<p>When he was alive, Lucio was a fair skinned man with blonde hair and pale eyes. His eyebrows existed in a strange shape and are naturally blonde, although he dyes them black. He dressed richly with furs, gold medals, sleek-heeled boots and love cut shirt and jacket. He has an enchanted, golden prosthetic in place of his left arm, with gold amour plating that can be removed. The arm has veins of light between the pieces and joints, which are white in official artwork but red during the plague. Currently Lucio appears as a phantom, one armed goat man. He has silky white fur and tall, twisting horns. He also has hands with long, knobby fingers and black claws, rather than hooves. His left arm ends just below the shoulder, capped by a thick scar. This appearance closely resembles his depiction in the Feast painting, although in the painting he has both arms and is clothed.</p>
<p>Lucio is frequently described as High-Class Trash by the Devs. He is vain, volatile, and selfish, and denies things he disagrees with. His actions range from throwing an artist in the dungeons over artistic disagreements (the artist refused to paint breasts on a bird lady), to setting people on fire for insulting him. It has also been strongly implied he rips people’s hearts out, and used magic for racketeering. However, he was never abusive in any of his relationships, so that’s something. He still has no standards though. He exaggerates his suffering, loudly and dramatically, to wring sympathy out of anyone unfortunate enough to hear him. He also loves animals, and has a fondness for magic despite his lack of skill.</p>
<p>Accent: The developers have confirmed that Count Lucio has a Jersey accent. Though it is preferred, it is not required to audition for this character</p>
<p>Voice: Medium or mid-high range, sneaky, sly, manipulative, slightly seductive, rough</p>

<li>Nothing like the real thing... seeing, unable to feel... Such sweet torture... (Slightly cocky, longing, as if in a dream)</li>

<p>Since posting this, there have been a few developments that need to be added.</p>
<ol>
<li>ASB have outright refused eMerchant Services.</li>
<li>Account2Account by WindCave seems to be functioning properly, but there is a cosmetic issue in Shopify that will confuse the customer. Working on getting that solved with Shopify.</li>
<li>Westpac are the only ones left in New Zealand who have not yet given me a reply</li>
<li>Asiabill have not yet replied either. It’s been about a week, so I will follow up with them.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-problem" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/adventures_in_payment_processing/#the-problem" class="header-mark"></a>The Problem</h3>
<p>So you’re an up and coming Vape Shop in New Zealand, and you’re looking to take online payments. Guess what… <strong>You’re Fucked</strong>.</p>
<p>In recent months, practically every financial institution in New Zealand, has begun refusing; rejecting or banning and closing accounts of Vape Vendors across the country. This seems to be related to Visa clamping down on Vaping as an industry, classing it as a High Risk financial category.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no banks will take a stand against Visa, and our Vape community is far too small to fight it.</p>
<p>I decided that it’s time to figure out once and for all, which banks and payment processors will actually help (rather than hinder) our industry. Below, you’ll find a list of banks, their websites and their contact information. I’ve also added a couple of notes to each, telling you where they stand on providing eMerchant facilities to Vape Shops.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/adventures_in_payment_processing/#conclusion" class="header-mark"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>To be clear, I contacted each of these financial institutions personally. I made the phone calls; I contacted their sales teams; I checked their terms of service; I requested clarification. I’ve put in the leg work, so you don’t have too.</p>
<p>Based on the details above, this is my list of hopefuls, in order of preference:</p>
<ol>
<li>Westpac with WindCave Gateway</li>
<li>ASB with WindCave Gateway (no longer an option, see their listing above)</li>
<li>WindCave Account2Account</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that WindCave is listed 3 times. This is because WindCave have offered to be a payment gateway for any eMerchant services provider we can give them. They’ve been the most supportive so far, and are the <strong>only</strong> group to have offered <strong>any</strong> solution, with their <strong>Account2Account</strong> product. I have to give them Kudos for that. It takes balls to step up to the plate and do the right thing, when everyone else takes the easy road.</p>
<p>As a side note, we’ve decided to definitely go with <strong>Account2Account</strong> from WindCave. We don’t like the idea of using POLi, as it would be subject to not only New Zealand laws, but also Australian rules and regulations. WindCave is a wholly New Zealand entity. If anyone is able to navigate the New Zealand political landscape, I would much rather it be in the hands of a company in New Zealand.</p>
<p>In the end, this hasn’t been the most fruitful Endeavor, but it has yielded some interesting results.</p>
<p>Firstly, that almost no Bank in New Zealand will stand up to Visa.</p>
<p>Secondly, that the <strong>only</strong> institution who offered a possible solution, is Kiwi owned; and <strong>not even a Bank</strong>.</p>
<p>Let that sink in. WindCave is <strong>NOT</strong> a bank.</p>
<h3 id="final-notes" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/adventures_in_payment_processing/#final-notes" class="header-mark"></a>Final Notes</h3>
<p>The Vape industry in New Zealand is defined by the New Zealand Government as an <strong>Essential Service</strong>, but not a single bank (with the exception of ASB and Westpac, as we’re waiting on replies) will support their function in a post Covid-19 world.</p>
<p>We’re forced to move a lot of our business online, due to Social Distancing and lockdown rules, but Visa and Banks are making it as difficult as possible for us to function.</p>
<p>This is some of the worst bullshit I’ve seen from Banks in a long time.</p>
<p>It’s time for something to change.</p>
