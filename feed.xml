<p>Since posting this, there have been a few developments that need to be added.</p>
<ol>
<li>ASB have outright refused eMerchant Services.</li>
<li>Account2Account by WindCave seems to be functioning properly, but there is a cosmetic issue in Shopify that will confuse the customer. Working on getting that solved with Shopify.</li>
<li>Westpac are the only ones left in New Zealand who have not yet given me a reply</li>
<li>Asiabill have not yet replied either. It’s been about a week, so I will follow up with them.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-problem" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/adventures_in_payment_processing/#the-problem" class="header-mark"></a>The Problem</h3>
<p>So you’re an up and coming Vape Shop in New Zealand, and you’re looking to take online payments. Guess what… <strong>You’re Fucked</strong>.</p>
<p>In recent months, practically every financial institution in New Zealand, has begun refusing; rejecting or banning and closing accounts of Vape Vendors across the country. This seems to be related to Visa clamping down on Vaping as an industry, classing it as a High Risk financial category.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no banks will take a stand against Visa, and our Vape community is far too small to fight it.</p>
<p>I decided that it’s time to figure out once and for all, which banks and payment processors will actually help (rather than hinder) our industry. Below, you’ll find a list of banks, their websites and their contact information. I’ve also added a couple of notes to each, telling you where they stand on providing eMerchant facilities to Vape Shops.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/adventures_in_payment_processing/#conclusion" class="header-mark"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>To be clear, I contacted each of these financial institutions personally. I made the phone calls; I contacted their sales teams; I checked their terms of service; I requested clarification. I’ve put in the leg work, so you don’t have too.</p>
<p>Based on the details above, this is my list of hopefuls, in order of preference:</p>
<ol>
<li>Westpac with WindCave Gateway</li>
<li>ASB with WindCave Gateway (no longer an option, see their listing above)</li>
<li>WindCave Account2Account</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that WindCave is listed 3 times. This is because WindCave have offered to be a payment gateway for any eMerchant services provider we can give them. They’ve been the most supportive so far, and are the <strong>only</strong> group to have offered <strong>any</strong> solution, with their <strong>Account2Account</strong> product. I have to give them Kudos for that. It takes balls to step up to the plate and do the right thing, when everyone else takes the easy road.</p>
<p>As a side note, we’ve decided to definitely go with <strong>Account2Account</strong> from WindCave. We don’t like the idea of using POLi, as it would be subject to not only New Zealand laws, but also Australian rules and regulations. WindCave is a wholly New Zealand entity. If anyone is able to navigate the New Zealand political landscape, I would much rather it be in the hands of a company in New Zealand.</p>
<p>In the end, this hasn’t been the most fruitful Endeavor, but it has yielded some interesting results.</p>
<p>Firstly, that almost no Bank in New Zealand will stand up to Visa.</p>
<p>Secondly, that the <strong>only</strong> institution who offered a possible solution, is Kiwi owned; and <strong>not even a Bank</strong>.</p>
<p>Let that sink in. WindCave is <strong>NOT</strong> a bank.</p>
<h3 id="final-notes" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/adventures_in_payment_processing/#final-notes" class="header-mark"></a>Final Notes</h3>
<p>The Vape industry in New Zealand is defined by the New Zealand Government as an <strong>Essential Service</strong>, but not a single bank (with the exception of ASB and Westpac, as we’re waiting on replies) will support their function in a post Covid-19 world.</p>
<p>We’re forced to move a lot of our business online, due to Social Distancing and lockdown rules, but Visa and Banks are making it as difficult as possible for us to function.</p>
<p>This is some of the worst bullshit I’ve seen from Banks in a long time.</p>
<p>It’s time for something to change.</p>

                <p>Scams related to the tragedy of Sars-CoV-2 are absolutely disgusting, but nefarious people will go out of their way to rip every last penny out of the pockets of those suffering.</p>
<p>When it comes to relevant information about Covid19, the best place to get legitimate and real information is from the NZ Government site located at <a href="https://covid19.govt.nz/">https://covid19.govt.nz</a></p>
<p>Here are a few types of scams, and possible ways to keep yourself safe.</p>
<h3 id="common-types-of-coronavirus-scams">Common types of Coronavirus scams</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Phishing</strong> emails and phone calls impersonating entities. These include the World Health Organisation, government authorities, people confirmed to have the coronavirus, and legitimate businesses such as travel agents and telecommunications companies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>People</strong> receiving misinformation about the coronavirus, being sent by text, social media and email</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Products</strong> claiming to be a vaccine or cure for the coronavirus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investment</strong> scams claiming coronavirus has created opportunities</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-protect-yourself">How to protect yourself</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Be aware</strong> of fraudulent emails claiming to be from experts saying that they have information about the virus. For the most up-to-date information about the coronavirus, visit the Department of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be careful</strong> of fake online shopping sites requesting unusual payment methods such as upfront payment via money order, wire transfer, international funds transfer, preloaded card or electronic currency, like Bitcoin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To detect</strong> a fake trader or social media online shopping scam is, search for reviews before purchasing. No vaccine or cure presently exists for the coronavirus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dont</strong> let anyone pressure you to make quick decisions. Take your time and consider who you are dealing with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dont</strong> click on links from sources you dont know. They could download viruses onto your computer or device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dont</strong> open attachments or click on links in emails, text messages or social media messages youve received from strangers. Just press delete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Never</strong> respond to unsolicited messages and calls that ask for personal or financial details â€” just press delete or hang up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Always</strong> keep your computer security up to date with anti-virus and anti-spyware software, and a good firewall. Only buy computer and anti-virus software from a reputable source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you are planning to donate</strong>, do your research. If you are donating to crowdfunding requests, check the terms and conditions of funding platforms and ensure you are dealing with official organisations.</p>

<h3 id="how-will-you-remain-safe-on-a-site-visit">How will you remain safe on a site visit?</h3>
<p>Things we know for certain are that the virus is likely to enter either through the mouth or eyes. PPE’s (personal protective equipment) is a good idea. A facemask, safety glasses and gloves. We also know that the virus is susceptible to soap, but not hand sanitizer. Frequent washing of hands is also a good idea.</p>
<p>Social distancing is a good method to decrease transfer or infection between people, so a 2 meter personal boundary is ideal.</p>

                <h3 id="choosing-life-or-choosing-to-live" class="headerLink">Choosing life, or choosing to live</h3>
<p>Everyone is on edge at the moment, trying to decide when to self isolate. What is the point of no return? Do I continue to work? Can I afford to pay my bills? If I get infected, will that put my family at risk? Do I isolate everyone in my family, or just myself? There is so much to take into account, it’s daunting. The feeling of being put into the position of being responsible for the health and wellbeing of others is always going to be difficult, but this situation makes it even more difficult.</p>
<p>Running a couple of businesses and having two kids has raised a few hard questions that we’ve had to answer. We’ve spent countless hours trying to figure out what to do, and it’s definitely… not easy. I feel for the people who have immunocompromised family members, or family who are in the at risk categories. Our family is fairly healthy, so we’re not too concerned, but for those less fortunate than us, it has to be a very scary time.</p>
<p>How do we keep living? How do we move forward? Is there any way we can continue to live, or is our only choice to subsist. We’ve seen similar clichés pop up in movies over the years, with the likes of zombie outbreaks and vampirism. But this is all too real.</p>
<h3 id="what-have-we-chosen-to-do" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/covid-19_and_isolation/#what-have-we-chosen-to-do" class="header-mark"></a>What have we chosen to do?</h3>
<p>We’re going to isolate as best as we can, regardless of if we do or don’t contract COVID-19. The main reasons are quite simple.</p>
<p>If we <strong>do not</strong> contract the virus, we need to keep it at bay as long as possible. This has a fair few knock on effects. Basically, we don’t want to contribute to an overloaded health system, and we don’t want to contribute to the spread of the virus. We want to help keep the progression of the virus under control, and the best way to do that, is to try to keep it at bay as long as we can.</p>
<p>We also have a fair amount of family members in the at risk categories, and the last thing we want, is to be responsible for causing them any unnecessary suffering. We don’t want to cause <em>anyone</em> any suffering for that matter. It would be too much to bear if we found out we were the cause of pain for anyone else.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we <strong>do</strong> contract the virus, then we will isolate anyway, so it’s better to start out mostly isolated to begin with.</p>
<p>But then, how do we continue to live, and not just subsist? Isolation does not have to be the end of the world. The way we figure it, based on the current research, infection occurs through the mouth and eyes, possibly nose. So can we continue to keep the businesses running during this crisis?</p>
<h3 id="keeping-the-business-open" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/covid-19_and_isolation/#keeping-the-business-open" class="header-mark"></a>Keeping the business open</h3>
<p>We know the methods of transmission, so guarding against the transmission is the best way to move forward. But what does that mean for the businesses? We’ve decided to keep them open as long as possible, <em>but</em> we will need to put in place some rules so that either we’re unlikely to get infected, <em>or</em> we are unlikely to infect others.</p>
<p>In the coming days, we’ll be designing methods to allow us to continue trading, without putting us all at risk.</p>
<p>Simple things that could make all the difference include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wearing a face mask</li>
<li>Wearing disposable gloves</li>
<li>Wearing protective glasses</li>
<li>Washing our hands after every customer</li>
<li>Keeping a reasonable distance between us and customers</li>
<li>Not having direct contact with customers</li>
<li>No samples or testers</li>
<li>Disinfecting communal surfaces like the counter</li>
<li>Using contactless payment methods like PayWave and Bank transfers</li>
<li>More to come…</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the possible rules we’ll implement, there are a fair few more that we’re still talking about. Basically, we’re thinking about setting up a kind of invisible barrier, so that we can continue to help our customers, without contributing to the problem.</p>
<h3 id="move-forward" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/covid-19_and_isolation/#move-forward" class="header-mark"></a>Move forward</h3>
<p>Just remember to be safe; stay as healthy as you can, and do all you can to look after the people closest to you. Be prepared, but don’t panic.</p>
<p>Think of those around you. The person who is infected should not be ostracised. The person who is not yet infected, is not a target of jealousy.</p>
<p>We’re in this together, let’s just get through this. :)</p>

                <p>Well… I’ve been working my ass off trying to move forward with this blog. Big changes on the home front with all the preparations for Fibre Internet. Of course the vast majority of changes are put on hold now, due to the COVID-19 outbreak. But the work continues… one of the joys of being socially isolated anyway.</p>
<h3 id="whats-been-happening" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/new_workflow/#whats-been-happening" class="header-mark"></a>What’s been happening?</h3>
<p>The upgrades have gone well so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>New 12U Open Server Rack (finally!)</li>
<li>New Rack Mount 4U Server Case
<ul>
<li>Ryzen 5 2600 CPU, 6 Cores/12 Threads</li>
<li>16GB (4x8GB) RAM</li>
<li>500GB Samsung EVO Plus NVMe</li>
<li>420W ATX Power Supply</li>
<li>2x LG DVD Writers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New 16 Port Gigabit Ethernet SMC Managed Switch</li>
<li>Old 16 Port Gigabit Ethernet TP-Link Unmanaged Switch</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of software, I’m sticking with my “go to” distro, Ubuntu Server 18.04. Still not a fan of netplan, and have a bit of difficulty getting my head around it, but I’m sure I’ll get there eventually.</p>
<p>Using Ubuntu as the base OS, I’ve already got docker installed and running. It’s running a lot smoother than I anticipated, having had far fewer errors and road bumps than I had on my previous setup. I suppose the experience of the previous server prepared me well for this go around.</p>
<p>Traefik is my reverse proxy, with Cloudflare in front playing the part of my DDoS mitigation.</p>
<p>I’ve recently come across a new application that may appeal to those data hoarders like me, called <a href="https://github.com/HaveAGitGat/Tdarr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Tdarr</a>. It’s a transcoder that runs in Docker, but not just a simple input/output application - It has user defined logic that can be used to actually make decisions about which media to encode; repair, or leave alone. It also has the ability to check your media files, and look for potential errors or corruptions.</p>
<p>Have a look at it <a href="https://github.com/HaveAGitGat/Tdarr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">here</a> - <strong>nb.</strong> <em>beware, it is still in beta</em></p>
<p>If like me, you’re constantly running out of disk space, then give it a go. It’s saved me almost a Terabyte over the last month. Well worth it.</p>
<p>Another one I’m running is <a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Gitea</a> where I can keep all of my scripts, and other projects. It makes for a great intermediary between <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Hugo</a> and NGINX behind Traefik.</p>
<p>One of the joys of Git, is that there are clients for it on practically every platform out there. This means, I can write something for my blog, no matter what machine I want to use. I can write from anywhere, on any OS, with any number of different apps. And because Hugo uses Markdown, it makes the process of writing an article so much easier with just a normal keyboard. No need for special characters etc.</p>
<p>I’ve also managed to install <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Pi-Hole</a> and have already noticed a small, but marked decrease in my internet traffic. Who knew online advertising would consume so much data?</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Nextcloud</a>. This is one of my daily drivers. It’s where I backup all of my pictures and documents. The tin foil hat paranoid schitzo voice in my head refuses to trust the likes of Microsoft; Google; Amazon and Facebook. The general rule of thumb is “If you’re not paying for the service, then you are the product”.</p>
<p>Privacy is a right, use it.</p>

                <p>The interrupted debate continues in this video, where Ms. Salesa makes the case that Public Health has struggled with finding a method of quitting smoking that actually works. She goes on to point out some of the more obvious things that we are already well aware of (having been in the industry for years now). I mean, <em>seriously</em> obvious things, like “Nicotine is addictive, but not the most harmful chemical in cigarettes”.</p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe width="665" height="548" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/397061067?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=8dc7dc" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" ></iframe></figure>
<p>NB. The commentary I provide in this post, is purely based on the video above, and does not reflect information that I am well aware is available to the Minister in question. Almost every statement I make here is based solely on my thoughts while watching the video, not the regulations contained in the Bill itself. I have read the Bill, and will spend more time reviewing it before I give an opinion on it.</p>
<p>She comes across as a little disingenuous and flat out misleading when it comes to some of her statements though. She seems to be ignorant (or at least uninformed), as she relies on her own personal experiences with family and friends, or the work of others (which I don’t think she fully understands) to build her case.</p>
<p>So where did she go off the (well trodden and well researched) rails?</p>
<h4 id="nicotine" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/vaping_amendment_bill_pt.2/#nicotine" class="header-mark"></a>Nicotine</h4>
<ul>
<li>“…sufficient levels of nicotine, the addictive substance that is craved…” - no mention of all of the thousands of other chemical compounds that are much more addictive</li>
<li>“…people would be able to inhale the nicotine they craved…” - again, doubling down on nicotine as the culprit for addiction</li>
<li>“…trendy nicotine products…” - Does this ever end? Make her stop talking…</li>
<li>“…we don’t want a new generation hooked on nicotine.” - Give it up… please…</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="marketing" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/vaping_amendment_bill_pt.2/#marketing" class="header-mark"></a>Marketing</h4>
<ul>
<li>“…some vaping companies have demonstrated aggressive marketing to our young people…” - OH! I see. She’s referring to Juul. I know this, because she’s not cited any other sources for this information, and it’s the only relevant case that could actually support her argument. So how are they (Juul) marketing to <em>our</em> young people, considering that they don’t trade in New Zealand, and have no real presence here?</li>
<li>“…nicotine is a highly addictive substance that companies have in the past, chosen to introduce to children…” - I’m noticing a trend here. Out of curiosity, what products in the last 40 years, have been introduced directly to children in a blatant attempt to get them hooked on nicotine?</li>
<li>“…the practices nicotine companies engaged in (in the past)…” - I think she means ‘Tobacco Companies’. Nicotine companies barely advertise at all, let alone to kids. Hell, even Tobacco companies don’t advertise to kids anymore, and haven’t done so for decades. It is <em>illegal</em> to advertise cigarettes to children. But she knew that, right? Sounds to me like she’s building a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">straw man</a> argument.</li>
<li>“…a recent paper from Stanford University’s School of Medicine, found that Juul…” - Nailed it.</li>
<li>“…I’ve seen Vaping advertising on TV…” - But no-one under the age of 50 actually watches TV…</li>
<li>“With this Bill, we are acting to stop the sale of Vaping products to young people under the age of 18…” - No reputable vendor will sell to anyone under the age of 18. The vast majority already ask for ID, and have been self regulating for years.</li>
<li>“…ban advertising [sic] to children and young people…” - We’re really focussing on this particular subject.</li>
<li>“…restrict flavors like watermelon; cheery cola; berry appealing…” - Why restrict the flavors, if they’re not marketed to children in the first place? Vendors in New Zealand make a concerted effort to actively <em>avoid</em> marketing to children, but it is a well known fact that the variety of flavors is one of the major reasons that Vaping continues to help thousands of people quit smoking.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="safety" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/vaping_amendment_bill_pt.2/#safety" class="header-mark"></a>Safety</h4>
<ul>
<li>“…require child resistant packaging…” - All eliquid manufacturers in NZ use Child Proof caps, and vendors sell hardware in shrink wrapped packaging. Again, this has been self imposed regulation.</li>
<li>“…extend the current smoke-free areas legislation for tobacco, to vaping…” - So she seems to want ex-smokers, to be forced to stand around with current smokers. Potentially exposing Vapers to second-hand smoke, and the temptation and peer pressure associated with cigarette smoking… because, reasons?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="epidemiology" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/vaping_amendment_bill_pt.2/#epidemiology" class="header-mark"></a>Epidemiology</h4>
<ul>
<li>“…vaping products carry the same (addiction) risk (to children)” - Cite your sources, or <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=GTFO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">GTFO</a></li>
<li>“…vaping is becoming far too common, especially in schools…” - The research would disagree with her <a href="https://www.ash.org.nz/surge_strategy_smokefree2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">1</a>;<a href="https://www.vapingpost.com/2020/01/31/nz-study-finds-no-teen-vaping-epidemic-in-new-zealand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">2</a>. Didn’t she just say that there was <em>no</em> epidemic in New Zealand?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="product-safety" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/vaping_amendment_bill_pt.2/#product-safety" class="header-mark"></a>Product Safety</h4>
<ul>
<li>“At the heart of our regime is a notification system.” - The explanation provided of what this <em>system</em> involves, is absolutely obvious. What <em>is</em> notable, particularly because of its absence, is <em>how</em> this system will be implemented. Is there going to be an office that will accept submissions only by registered mail? Will they test on site? Will there be a list of approved ingredients? Who will make the decisions about what is safe and what is not? Who will be responsible for the decisions? How much will it cost? Where is the revenue for research and testing going to come from? Is there going to be an independent lab setup to accomplish the testing? What are the turn around times? Come on, this is ridiculous, if only for it’s complete lack of transparency. I listen to the words, but all I hear is “Tax Grab”</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="stupid-political-posturing-and-misleading-statements" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/vaping_amendment_bill_pt.2/#stupid-political-posturing-and-misleading-statements" class="header-mark"></a>Stupid Political Posturing and Misleading Statements</h4>
<ul>
<li>“…regulating Vaping is not that simple.” - Yes it is. We’ve been doing the Governments job for them, for years. We’ve been doing it better than they could.</li>
<li>“…this is a future proof regime.” - I don’t think <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/regime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">regime</a> means what she think it means. Please… stop using it.</li>
<li>“…future governments can be swift in responding to emerging problems…” - The problems that have been clearly stated do not exist currently, and the research shows has yet to come to fruition?</li>
<li>“…the ministry to follow up rapidly if there are any safety concerns.” - There seems to be another sticking point here. Yes there are concerns, but they are around personal safety, and the reasons for the issues are a lack of education. A Vaper needs to be aware of things like nicotine levels, battery safety and poisoning. They aren’t concerned that the flavor they’re puffing on may be contaminated. Why? Because Vendors in New Zealand are swift and ruthless with anyone who tries to offload faulty or contaminated products on their customers. Again, we do the governments job for them, better than they can.</li>
<li>“…regulation on the maximum nicotine levels (contained in e-liquid).” - Really? Does the Government know the different requirements for every new Vaper trying to quit smoking? The social smoker, and the 3 pack a day smoker? Does the government keep records of all smokers, and how much they consume? Or is this something that Vendors are much better positioned to understand. I have a feeling it would be the latter over the former.</li>
<li>“…this bill has elegantly…” - is she kidding? It’s not even in the same ballpark as <em>elegant</em>. It’s a mish-mash of cherry picked information, and half understood research, that seeks to regulate and gain all the benefits of revenue from the industry, while relegating Vapers to being shunned, just like smokers. It’s basically a stolen manuscript, that is being passed off as original, with a few tweaks to try and pull in some of that sweet sweet Vaping <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fetty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">fetty</a> for <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gubment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Big Gubment</a>.</li>
<li>“What I’ve learned through developing this Vape Bill…” - You didn’t develop it, you stole it from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicky_Wagner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Nicky Wagner</a>. This bill is essentially a poor re-wording of the orginial proposed by MP Wagner in mid 2018. The original is available <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/resource/en-NZ/52HOH_MEMBILL086_1/3bcd3e4000ccff32aadb721936988e41a33b8036" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">here</a> for comparison. So not only was it stolen, but it took 2 years, and untold amounts of money to plagiarize actual work, and pass it off as your own…</li>
<li>“…our regime gives them (specialty Vape Stores) a role behind the counter on how to quit…” - Oh god. Stop with the buzz phrases, you’re not using them correctly. How to quit? We already know how this works, and the Government is coming to the party after the DJ has already left. We’ve been doing this longer, and have more experience than Government could hope to have. Back the fuck up.</li>

<ul>
<li>“…vaping is significantly less harmful than smoking tobacco.”</li>
<li>“…it is a disruptive technology.”</li>
<li>“…there is no epidemic in New Zealand.”</li>
<li>“…prevent the sale on our beaches over summer…”</li>
<li>“…if you do not currently smoke, do <em>not</em> take up Vaping.”</li>
<li>“…if you are a smoker, then Vaping is substantially less harmful to you and your body…”</li>
<li>“How we’ve accomplished this is to confer a greater set of rights and responsibilities onto R18 specialty Vape stores,”</li>
<li>“…there are some very responsible Vaping retailers, particularly some of our specialist Vaping Shop owners.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion" class="headerLink"><a href="https://vapefam.fun/vaping_amendment_bill_pt.2/#conclusion" class="header-mark"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Holy shit, there is a ton to unpack there. It was almost painful to sit through, and to be completely honest, at about 7:30 I had to stop. She was coming back around to the “think of the children” point, and trying to hammer it home. I can only assume she was trying to win support with the sympathy vote. Fortunately, there are a few MP’s who won’t stand for that kind of thing, and are willing to call her out on it. This isn’t and <em>shouldn’t</em> be about the children. Yes, keep the children safe, but don’t potentially damage an entire industry because you don’t understand the research.</p>
<p>I found Ms. Salesa contradicted herself a little too often for me to take her very seriously. With statements like “There is no epidemic in New Zealand”, and then moments later saying “Vaping is becoming far too common, especially in schools.”</p>
<p>This is both contradictory, and a loaded statement. It implies that Vaping in general, is too common. But the point to make is that Vaping numbers are <em>supposed</em> to increase as the smoking rates <em>decrease</em>. That’s how quitting smoking via Vaping works. Conflating the rise in vaping with vaping in schools is misleading.</p>
<p>At this point, it’s not clear whether Ms. Salesa is for or against Vaping as either a recreational hobby, or as a tool to quit smoking. It makes me wonder how many alcohol drinkers would be pissed off if we restricted their favorite beverages to only a Rose Wine, and a Larger beer? No more white or red wine. No more Pilsner or Stout. No more Top Shelf, as the alcohol content would be regulated and far too high to meet the regulations.</p>

<p>At around the 1:54 mark of the video, The Speaker of the House interrupts the reading.  He can be seen standing and holding a folded piece of paper.  He states clearly that this debate is "Interrupted" and calls for resumption on Tuesday the 10th.  The video then ends abruptly.<br><br>This left more than a few people yelling "What the fuck?"<br><br>The Vaping industry in NZ has been hanging out for this release, and from what we can see of the proposed bill and its amendments, this could be one of the best outcomes we could have hoped for. So when the Speaker of the House stood up and basically called an end to the sitting, it surprised more or less the industry and watchers as a whole.<br><br>Some speculation has come up since then, about what it means; why he was holding paper; has more research come to light etc...<br><br>While it is the complete opposite of my normal outlook, I'm going to play the optimist in this situation.  Lets address each of those rumours one by one. </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What does this mean?</strong>  Likely just the house shutting down for the day</li>
<li><strong>Why was he holding paper?</strong>  Probably a note from a colleague reminding him of the time of day</li>
<li><strong>Why did he shut down Ms Salesa, instead of letting her finish?</strong>  Given it was the end of the day, and the paper being quite lengthy, it was probably a better option to stop her in the beginning, rather than let her get deep into the reading.</li>
<li><strong>Has more research come to light?</strong>  Unlikely.  There is a possibility, but even if it had, it would never be so ground-breaking as to stop a reading of a Bill, let alone force a complete rewrite of the Bill in question.</li>
</ol>
<p>Right now, I think we're all a bit touchy and feeling somewhat paranoid, because we've been burned in the past.  We've also seen how nasty the Governments of other countries can truly get when they want to shut down the Vaping Industry.  We're hopeful, and somewhat scared of what this could mean for not only vapers, but vendors as well.<br><br>Over the next few weeks, I'll go through the proposed Bill, and post thoughts about what I think is going on.  Should we be worried?  Probably.  Is it going to hurt?  Likely.<br><br><strong>BUT</strong> - It's not worth getting upset about, <em>yet</em>.<br><br><br><br></p>
