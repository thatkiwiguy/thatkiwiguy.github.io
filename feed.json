            "content_html": "<p>Count Lucio used to rule Vesuvia with his wife, Nadia until he was murdered three years before the start of the game. Allegedly he was burned alive in his bed by Julian Devorak, on the night of the masquerade – a city wide birthday celebration he threw himself. Now he haunts the palace, but he is not out for revenge.</p>\n<p>When he was alive, Lucio was a fair skinned man with blonde hair and pale eyes. His eyebrows existed in a strange shape and are naturally blonde, although he dyes them black. He dressed richly with furs, gold medals, sleek-heeled boots and love cut shirt and jacket. He has an enchanted, golden prosthetic in place of his left arm, with gold amour plating that can be removed. The arm has veins of light between the pieces and joints, which are white in official artwork but red during the plague. Currently Lucio appears as a phantom, one armed goat man. He has silky white fur and tall, twisting horns. He also has hands with long, knobby fingers and black claws, rather than hooves. His left arm ends just below the shoulder, capped by a thick scar. This appearance closely resembles his depiction in the Feast painting, although in the painting he has both arms and is clothed.</p>\n<p>Lucio is frequently described as High-Class Trash by the Devs. He is vain, volatile, and selfish, and denies things he disagrees with. His actions range from throwing an artist in the dungeons over artistic disagreements (the artist refused to paint breasts on a bird lady), to setting people on fire for insulting him. It has also been strongly implied he rips people’s hearts out, and used magic for racketeering. However, he was never abusive in any of his relationships, so that’s something. He still has no standards though. He exaggerates his suffering, loudly and dramatically, to wring sympathy out of anyone unfortunate enough to hear him. He also loves animals, and has a fondness for magic despite his lack of skill.</p>\n<p>Accent: The developers have confirmed that Count Lucio has a Jersey accent.

Guess what… <strong>You’re Fucked</strong>.</p>\n<p>In recent months, practically every financial institution in New Zealand, has begun refusing; rejecting or banning and closing accounts of Vape Vendors across the country. This seems to be related to Visa clamping down on Vaping as an industry, classing it as a High Risk financial category.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, no banks will take a stand against Visa, and our Vape community is far too small to fight it.</p>\n<p>I decided that it’s time to figure out once and for all, which banks and payment processors will actually help (rather than hinder) our industry. Below, you’ll find a list of banks, their websites and their contact information. I’ve also added a couple of notes to each, telling you where they stand on providing eMerchant facilities to Vape Shops.</p>\n<h3 id=\"results\" class=\"headerLink\"><a href=\"https://vapefam.fun/adventures_in_payment_processing/#results\" class=\"header-mark\"></a>Results</h3>\n<p><strong>BNZ</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Website</em>: <a href=\"https://www.kiwibank.co.nz/business-banking/\">https://www.kiwibank.co.nz/business-banking/</a></li>\n<li><em>Contact Number</em>: 0800 269 763</li>\n<li><em>Notes</em>: BNZ directly refuse to provide eMerchant services for our industry.

In store EFTPOS is fine when using a normal Merchant bank account.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\" class=\"headerLink\"><a href=\"https://vapefam.fun/adventures_in_payment_processing/#conclusion\" class=\"header-mark\"></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>To be clear, I contacted each of these financial institutions personally. I made the phone calls; I contacted their sales teams; I checked their terms of service; I requested clarification. I’ve put in the leg work, so you don’t have too.</p>\n<p>Based on the details above, this is my list of hopefuls, in order of preference:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Westpac with WindCave Gateway</li>\n<li>ASB with WindCave Gateway (no longer an option, see their listing above)</li>\n<li>WindCave Account2Account</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that WindCave is listed 3 times. This is because WindCave have offered to be a payment gateway for any eMerchant services provider we can give them. They’ve been the most supportive so far, and are the <strong>only</strong> group to have offered <strong>any</strong> solution, with their <strong>Account2Account</strong> product. I have to give them Kudos for that. It takes balls to step up to the plate and do the right thing, when everyone else takes the easy road.</p>\n<p>As a side note, we’ve decided to definitely go with <strong>Account2Account</strong> from WindCave. We don’t like the idea of using POLi, as it would be subject to not only New Zealand laws, but also Australian rules and regulations. WindCave is a wholly New Zealand entity. If anyone is able to navigate the New Zealand political landscape, I would much rather it be in the hands of a company in New Zealand.</p>\n<p>In the end, this hasn’t been the most fruitful Endeavor, but it has yielded some interesting results.</p>\n<p>Firstly, that almost no Bank in New Zealand will stand up to Visa.</p>\n<p>Secondly, that the <strong>only</strong> institution who offered a possible solution, is Kiwi owned; and <strong>not even a Bank</strong>.</p>\n<p>Let that sink in. WindCave is <strong>NOT</strong> a bank.</p>\n<h3 id=\"final-notes\" class=\"headerLink\"><a href=\"https://vapefam.fun/adventures_in_payment_processing/#final-notes\" class=\"header-mark\"></a>Final Notes</h3>\n<p>The Vape industry in New Zealand is defined by the New Zealand Government as an <strong>Essential Service</strong>, but not a single bank (with the exception of ASB and Westpac, as we’re waiting on replies) will support their function in a post Covid-19 world.</p>\n<p>We’re forced to move a lot of our business online, due to Social Distancing and lockdown rules, but Visa and Banks are making it as difficult as possible for us to function.</p>\n<p>This is some of the worst bullshit I’ve seen from Banks in a long time.</p>\n<p>It’s time for something to change.</p>",
